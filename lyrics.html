          <p>I am only made of flesh and blood.<br>
          She is the rain, the river and the floods.<br>
          She opens the way for me<br>
          and sees what no one else can see.</p>

          <p>I have followed her into the sea,<br>
          where the ocean spirit waits for me.<br>
          the great spirit of the waters:<br>
          the ocean's only daughter,</p>

          <p>who cries when the tides rise<br>
          and makes the rain fall.</p>

          <p>when I travel far beneath,<br>
          I hear the sighs of those<br>
          who came before me.</p>

          <p>I hold out my hands and rise<br>

          <p>Soon, I will meet the ocean waves.<br>
          I will let them wash away<br>
          the sound of my name,<br>
          and the whisper that still remains.</p>

          <p>I will shape my silence to the rain.<br>
          I will let it wash away the moss from my face<br>
          and the dust that still remains.</p>

          <p>No, I am not okay.<br>
          the wind is calling out my name<br>
          toward the center of the pain<br>
          and the breaking waves.</p>

          <p>and he is out there with me on the sea,<br>

          while the many change and pass.<br>
          something strange looms over the bay<br>

          <p>and the time draws sooner still<br>
          when the earth will be filled<br>
          with the glory of god.</p>

          <p>if all that you are<br>

          our lives are defined<br>

          somewhere it might feel complete.</p>

          <p>Nights when I can't sleep I think<br>
          of patterns in the shadows along the street.<br>
          hopelessly I am wondering</p>

          <p>if the eye with which I see god<br>
          is the same eye through which<br>
          he sees me.</p>

          <p>Your silence speaks one million words,<br>
          but your words express nothing but silence.</p>

          <p>and where does the ocean meet the sky?<br>
          in the morning,<br>
          when a bright layer of light<br>
          dissolves the line<br>

          <p>the still image<br>

          <p>I have tried to live like water,<br>
          flowing beneath the stream.<br>
          I have followed the river’s daughter<br>
          toward the shelter of the sea.</p>

          <p>and I have seen<br>
          “That man is a stream<br>

          <p>I met Jesus Christ when I was 9 years old<br>
          he came dancing across the water<br>
          in a circle of gold.</p>

          <p>and his eyes were made of jewels.<br>
          he held out a lotus blossom<br>
          in his right hand<br>
          and asked me with a smile,<br>
          “Now do you understand?”</p>

          <p>He said, “There’s something evil<br>
          stirring in the heart of this land<br>
          where the lion never lays down with the lamb<br>
          and where men fight their battles with<br>
          the backs of their hands.”</p>

          <p>there’s a man on the water,<br>
          walking straight and free.<br>
          and if my ears could hold<br>
          the sound of the sea,<br>

          to lose the self would be to lose you as well,<br>
          which could only mean hell.</p>

          <p>The reflection of the moon over the bay<br>

          <p>and I’ve retraced what’s left of my being.<br>
          your face is all these eyes are seeing,<br>

          <p>It’s been two weeks since you covered me with wings<br>
          and left me without sleep;<br>
          seven days in the mouth of the beast.</p>

          <p>Angeline, is this always how it has to be?<br>
          I feel like Jacob when you wrestle with me,<br>
          or like a star setting over the sea.</p>

          <p>Please let me stay, we can do

 this some other way.<br>
          you are the ancient of days,<br>
          a whisper at heaven’s gate.</p>

          <p>many moons ago, she left him for another man<br>

          you would just be ashamed of me<br>
          and it would all slip away from away.</p>

          <p>entire oceans dissolve behind my eyes<br>
          i'm waiting for the right moment to end my life<br>
          but a spectrum of color<br>
          remains undefined.</p>

          <p>Black clouds, moonlight sun.<br>
          swallow the sound of what I have<br>
          failed to become.</p>

          <p>your body is a stream of light in the morning.</p>

          <p>black clouds, and blackened lungs.<br>
          the horizon fades with the sun.</p>

          <p>your body is a stream of color through a prism.</p>

          <p>Nothing is all that I am and all that I was not.</p>

          <p>There is only now. it’s all I can see.<br>
          It really isn’t me.</p>

          <p>Soon my pulse will be as cold as the sea.</p>

          <p>I am the sound of waves<br>
          Resounding into empty space.</p>
